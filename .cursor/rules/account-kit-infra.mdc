# account kit infra

- The @account-kit/signer package contains all of the interfaces and functions that allow you to interact with our Signer service. This package is designed for developers who want to build their own integrations using our Signer as an owner on Smart Accounts, but would rather bring their own infra or smart contract implementations.
- The @account-kit/smart-contracts package contains all of the definitions for our smart contracts. This package is designed for developers who want to use our smart contracts, but may want to use their own Signer or Infrastructre for sending user operations.
- The @account-kit/react packages contains hooks, components, and utilities that make it really easy to build Embedded Accounts within your React application. It handles all of the state management, provides UI Components for authenticating users, and provides simple to use hooks for interacting with smart accounts.
- The @account-kit/core package contains all of the functionality that allows us to manage state within @account-kit/react. It builds on top of @account-kit/infra, @account-kit/signer, and @account-kit/smart-contracts to provide you with a vertically integrated stack for building apps using our Embedded Accounts in your frontend applications. This package is designed to be used by developers who want a lot of the utility that the React package provides, but are building outside of the React ecosystem.
- The @account-kit/infra package contains all of the interfaces and functions that allow you to interact with our ERC-4337 bundler and ERC-7670 compliant Paymaster infrastructure. This package is designed for developers who want to build their own integrations with our infrastructure, but want to bring their own Signer or Smart Account implementations.
- The @aa-sdk/ethers contains adapters for the @aa-sdk/core interfaces so that you can use these interfaces with existing ethers.js libraries.
- The @aa-sdk/core package contains all of the core interfaces and functions for interacting with any ERC-4337 infrastructure and smart contracts. This package is the basis for all of the Account Kit packages and is designed to be used by developers who want to build their own integrations with 3rd party services. For the simplest integration with our products, consider using the @account-kit/* packages.
- Account Kit is the replacement for the following SDKs: @alchemy/aa-core @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-signers @alchemy/aa-accounts
