# Lit Account

- Switch your authNeededCallback to use an EOA signer.
If you want to use a smart account for transactions, use the EOA for Lit authentication, then use the smart account for your app logic.

## Are ModularV2Accounts accepted by Lit?
### Not as a direct EOA signer.
-If you try to use a smart contract account as a signer for SIWE or session signatures, it will fail, because the contract cannot sign messages in the ECDSA format required by SIWE and Lit session signatures.

### What to do instead:

#### For SCA users, you should use a supported authentication method, such as:
- Lit PKP (Programmable Key Pair)
- Social login (via Lit)
- Passkey (via Lit)
- For EOA users, use the standard ECDSA signature flow.

- No hook calls another that depends on itself.
- The component manages the PKP state and session sigs.
- Data flows:
-- User mints PKP â†’ updates PKP state
-- PKP state passed to useSessionSigs
-- getSessionSigs called as needed
-- Session sigs passed to mintPKP as needed
