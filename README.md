## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

CRTV4 is built on a modular architecture that integrates several key technologies:

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework with server components and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and consistent styling
- **shadcn/ui**: For UI components built on Radix UI primitives

### Web3 Stack

- **Account Kit by Alchemy**: For account abstraction, simplified onboarding, and wallet interactions
- **Livepeer**: For decentralized video streaming infrastructure with token-gating capabilities
- **Viem & Wagmi**: For Ethereum interactions and hooks

## üìö Key Features

- **Smart Accounts**: Account abstraction for improved UX and transaction management
- **Decentralized Video Hosting**: Leveraging Livepeer for reliable, censorship-resistant video content
- **Token-Gated Content**: Access control for premium content using NFTs
- **Livepeer AI Integration**: Video translation, transcription, and generation features
- **Leaderboard**: Track top creators and content
- **Multi-chain Support**: Built with cross-chain compatibility in mind

## üìê System Architecture

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Onboarding**:

   - Users can authenticate with or without a traditional wallet

2. **Session Management**:

   - Session signatures allow for persistent authentication
   - Smart account capabilities for seamless transactions

3. **Access Control**:
   - Token-gated content using NFTs and Livepeer's webhook system
   - Role-based permissions for creators and viewers

### Video Processing Pipeline

1. **Upload**:

   - Videos are uploaded to Livepeer's decentralized network
   - Metadata is stored with creator information and access controls

2. **Processing**:

   - Transcoding for optimal playback across devices
   - Optional AI processing for transcription, translation, or enhancement

3. **Delivery**:

   - Content delivered through Livepeer's CDN
   - Token-gating verification for protected content

4. **Analytics**:
   - View tracking and engagement metrics
   - Creator dashboard with performance insights

## üîó Account Kit & Lit Protocol Integration

CRTV4 features a sophisticated integration between Alchemy's Account Kit and Lit Protocol to provide a seamless, secure user experience:

### Integration Overview

The platform combines Account Kit's smart account capabilities with Lit Protocol's authentication and programmable key pairs (PKPs) to create a powerful user experience:

1. **Account Kit** provides:

   - Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs) using ERC-4337 account abstraction
   - Multi-chain transaction management
   - Simplified user onboarding with social logins
   - Bundled transaction support
   - Gas sponsorship capabilities
   - Session signatures for persistent authentication
   - Wallet-less authentication options

### Authentication Flow

The authentication process follows these steps:

1. User connects with Account Kit (social login, passkey, etc.)
2. For SCA users, a wallet address is minted via Account Kit
3. Session signatures are obtained for persistent authentication
4. The Smart Account handles blockchain transactions

### Technical Implementation

The codebase implements this integration through:

- **Smart Account Hook** (`useModularAccount`): Manages ModularAccountV2 instances from Account Kit
- **Session Management** (`useSessionSigs`): Handles authentication with Accoun Kit
- **Unified Signer** (`useUnifiedSessionSigner`): Combines different authentication approaches

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Authentication Method Compatibility**:

   - Smart Contract Accounts cannot directly sign messages in the ECDSA format.
   - The solution uses EOA signatures for Account Kit authentication while leveraging SCA for transactions

2. **Session Management**:

   - Session signatures expire and require refresh logic
   - The application implements debouncing and retry mechanisms

3. **Cross-System Identity**:
   - PKPs serve as the bridge between traditional authentication and blockchain operations
   - The system maintains consistent identity across both ecosystems

This integration enables CRTV4 to provide features like wallet-less authentication, seamless transaction experiences, and a unified user identity across both centralized and decentralized components.
